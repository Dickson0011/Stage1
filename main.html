                <H1>Year 1: Foundation and Mastery</H1>
                <p>
                    In the first year, my focus will be on learning the fundamentals and gaining proficiency in essential front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I progress, Iâ€™ll delve deeper into modern frameworks, such as React, Vue, or Angular, and work on increasingly complex projects that will help me apply my skills in real-world scenarios. By the end of the first year, I aim to have built a personal portfolio and deployed live projects, showcasing my capabilities to potential employers or collaborators.

            <h1>Year 2: Advancement and Specialization</h1>
            <p>
                The second year aims to broaden my skill set and explore advanced topics in front-end development. I will specialize in areas of interest, learn about advanced frameworks, and even touch on basic back-end development to become a more versatile developer. This year also emphasizes the importance of web accessibility, performance optimization, and advanced user interface design. By the end of the second year, I aim to be well-prepared to tackle job applications and interviews, with a robust portfolio and a deep understanding of both fundamental and advanced front-end development concepts.
